        <h2>Top <strong>3</strong> study spots in calgary</h2>
        <p>As a student living in the city, there are many places to consider studying. Many people choose on campus locations for convenience, but I personally enjoy working the atmosphere that a coffee shop provides. The following list are my top 3 favorite places to study in Calgary. I will be ranking them bases on location, overall vibe, and how busy they tend to be. </p>

               <h3>Number 3</h3>
               <h4>Startbucks, Crowfoot</h4>
               <p>This is a very study spot. It has free WIFI and a decent amount of comfortable seating. The store stays open till 9 pm making it a good spot to get a long study session in after classes. If you sit in the right spot you can watch as the sun sets casting a beautiful gradient of colors on to COP and the city below. I usually have no issue finding seat here. It's a nice spot for when I'm studying with friends who live in the area</p>

               <h3>Number 2</h3>
               <h4>AGGÜDO, Kensington</h4>
               <p>A very beautiful spot I’ve studied here a few times because of its proximity to the SAIT campus. Its located very close to the Sunnyside train station making it one the most transit accessible spots on my list. If you are a driver, you can usually find parking on the street nearby, but you will have to pay for parking. The vibes are really nice, with the store being on the corner outlooking the busy streets of Kensington. AGGUDO offers free WIFI of course, you just need to ask the very pleasant staff for the password. The reason this isn’t at the top of my list is because unfortunately I am not the only person who enjoys this spot, and I have had troubles finding a table to work at most hours of the day. I would say its the bussiest location on my list. </p>

                    <h4>Euphoria, Varsity</h4>
            <p>My favorite coffee shop to study at is Euphroia in Varsity. Its located very close to the Dalhousie train stating making it very transit accessible. Parking around there is also very easy for those who drive. The staff are always very lovely and happy to serve you. I like working here because it feels less busy and less distracting with the more closed concept. I tend to daydream so if I need to dive into work I like this spot the best.</p>
